## 🎮 Easter Eggs

### Konami Code
Enter the classic Konami code sequence to activate a special LeetSpeak mode:

**Sequence:** ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA

**Effects:**
- Text transforms to subtle LeetSpeak (readable 1337 style: A→4, E→3, I→1, O→0, etc.)
- Particle burst effect
- "L33T M0D3" indicator appears
- Auto-reverts after 30 seconds
- Press the code again to toggle off
- Press ESC to quickly exit

**URL Parameter:** Add `?leet=true` to any URL to auto-activate LeetSpeak mode

**Example:** `https://lome.dev?leet=true`
